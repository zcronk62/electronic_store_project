# Electronics Store Online Purchase History

## 1. Introduction

This project takes a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-purchase-history-from-electronics-store). The data set contains order information for 2.6+ million purchases made through an electronic store's online marketplace.

The purpose of this project will be to analyze the sales trends within the data. Does one type of electronic device sell better than the others? Is one brand trusted more than others by consumers visiting this online store? The aim is to answer these questions.

## 2. Methodology

This project makes use of Python3 through the jupyter notebook implementation. Data is loaded into a `pandas` dataframe and cleaned, analyzed and visualized using a combination of the `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` Python libraries.
